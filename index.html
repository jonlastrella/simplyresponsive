            <p>CSS uses the @media rule to detect information about 
                the device being used to acess
                the website. For example, 
                it can be used to detect the size of the device, 
                its capabilities,
                and it orientation. For this course, 
                we will be using it to detect the device sizie, 
                but keep in mind that it is capable 
                of much more.
